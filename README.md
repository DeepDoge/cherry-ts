# MASTER.TS
Master.ts is a framework for building SPA applications using TypeScript.   

## Warning
This is a work in progress prototype, and is not ready for production use.

## Coding
If you wanna work on this project, it is recommended to use https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts-workspace for better developer experience


## Example
https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts-vite-template

## Motivation
There are many frameworks out there, and many use their own file types, and require their own build tools.
Most of the time it is hard to understand what is happening under the hood of the framework.

Master.ts is aims to be as simple as possible, and as transparent as possible, while not sacrificing code readability.
Also, it aims to have parts that are reusable and portable. 

## Note
I was first trying to make something that has Resumable SSR, similar to Qwik.<br/>
And it was actually working out but i realized that i need to sacrafice many things in order to make it work right.<br/>
And since i was going to use this for IPFS and similar stuff without a server or cloud.<br/>
i thought SPA is good enough at least for now.<br/>
i can add and change features later.<br/>
its not like i need to make things backward competible, im gonna use this alone in my own projects, so i can make any breaking change i want, any syntax change i want, any change i want, later
