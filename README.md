## Example: purify.js + ShadowRoot

```ts
import { computed, css, fragment, ref, sheet, tags } from "purify-js"

const { div, button } = tags

const count = ref(0)
const double = computed(() => count.val * 2)

function App() {
    return div({ id: "app" }).children(Counter())
}

function Counter() {
    const host = div()
    const shadow = host.element.attachShadow({ mode: "open" })
    shadow.adoptedStyleSheets.push(counterStyle)

    shadow.append(
        fragment(
            button({ class: "my-button" })
                .onclick(() => count.val++)
                .children("Count:", count),
            ["Double:", double],
        ),
    )
    return host
}

const counterStyle = sheet(css`
    :host {
        display: grid;
        place-content: center;
    }

    .my-button {
        overflow-wrap: break-word;
    }
`)

document.adoptedStyleSheets.push(
    sheet(css`
        :root {
            color-scheme: dark;
        }
    `),
)

document.body.append(App().element)
```

## Motivation üç£

JavaScript frameworks are often large and complex. As your project grows, they can introduce obscure reactivity bugs and force you into their specific ecosystems, restricting your use of native browser APIs (Vanilla JavaScript). Many frameworks prevent direct DOM manipulation and struggle to keep up with new CSS features, resulting in poorly scoped CSS. Additionally, their reliance on custom file extensions and build steps can complicate the use of regular JavaScript or TypeScript files, leading to type-related issues.

**purify.js** aims to enhance the developer experience while keeping you as close to pure JavaScript as possible. Here‚Äôs how:

-   **Simple Reactivity**: By using signals, we maintain straightforward reactivity. Signals are easy to detect in the code using the `instanceof` keyword, and you have control over manually notifying signal followers with the `notify()` function. This eliminates the need to wrap unrelated logic inside functions like `update()`. Getters and setters further improve the developer experience, making it clear when you're working with a signal.

-   **Clear DOM Element Creation**: **purify.js** provides a simple and readable way to create DOM elements and templates with full type safety. It ensures a clear separation between element attributes and properties, so you always know what you‚Äôre setting.

-   **Minimal and Pure**: The library is minimal, focusing on providing signals and templating to enhance the developer experience. This approach reduces complexity and keeps your codebase closer to native JavaScript.

By keeping it pure, **purify.js** adds necessary functionality while avoiding the limitations and intricate bugs of modern JavaScript frameworks.

## Why Not JSX Templating?

-   **Lack of Type Safety**: JSX does not offer the same level of type safety, which decreases the developer experience.
-   **Build Step Required**: JSX requires a build step, adding complexity to the development workflow.

## What is Next?

-   **Element Lifecycles**: Addressing issues related to element lifecycles is a priority. Tracking when an element is connected or disconnected from the DOM without fully utilizing WebComponents is challenging. Currently, updating attributes with signals can lead to follower leaks. Mutation observers are not an ideal solution due to their asynchronous nature and inability to observe inside ShadowDOM. Potential solutions are being explored to keep the codebase small and efficient.
-   **JSDoc Support**: Enhancing JSDoc support is necessary, as maintaining both .js and .d.ts files is cumbersome. Generating .d.ts files from JSDoc has its own set of issues. Future improvements may involve finding alternative solutions or waiting for more robust JSDoc support.
-   **Real-World Application and PWA Template**: I plan to build a project with **purify.js** to ensure it works well in a complex environment. This process will help identify any gaps and refine the library. Additionally, I aim to create a PWA template or package focused on enhancing the **purify.js** experience for building progressive web apps.
