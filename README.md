# MASTER.TS
Master.ts is a frontend library for building single-page applications (SPAs) using Web Components and TypeScript. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with a focus on transparency and simplicity.

# Install
```bash
npm i https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts.git -D
```

## Warning
Please note that Master.ts is currently a work in progress prototype and is not ready for production use.

## Coding
If you want to work on this project, it is recommended to use the [Master.ts Workspace](https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts-workspace) for a better developer experience.

## Example
For an example of how to use Master.ts, see the [Master.ts Vite Template](https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts-vite-template).

## Motivation
There are many frontend frameworks and libraries available, but many of them come with a large number of dependencies and can be complex or not transparent in their implementation. Master.ts is a library that can be used with any framework or on its own, and has no external dependencies, making it very lightweight. The main goal of Master.ts is to create a library that is lightweight, easy to use, and transparent in its implementation. It aims to achieve this by avoiding unnecessary dependencies and complexity, and by being open about how it works.

## Note
Initially, the goal of Master.ts was to create a library with resumable server-side rendering (SSR), similar to Qwik. While it was possible to achieve this, it became clear that significant sacrifices would need to be made in order to make it work correctly. Since Master.ts is intended for use with platforms like IPFS, which do not have a server or cloud infrastructure, it was decided that an SPA was sufficient for now. It is possible that additional features and changes will be made in the future.
