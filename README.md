## Warning

## Coding
If you wanna work on this project, it is recommended to use https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts-workspace for better developer experience


## Example
https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts-vite-template

## Motivation
There are many frameworks out there, and many use their own file types, and require their own build tools.
Most of the time it is hard to understand what is happening under the hood of the framework.



Master.ts is aims to be as simple as possible, and as transparent as possible, while not sacrificing code readability.
Also, it aims to have parts that are reusable and portable.
