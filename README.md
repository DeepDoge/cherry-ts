# MASTER.TS
Master.ts is a frontend component library for making SPA, that is utilizing the Web Components, and is written in Typescript.

## Warning
This is a work in progress prototype, and is not ready for production use.

## Coding
If you wanna work on this project, it is recommended to use https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts-workspace for better developer experience


## Example
https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts-vite-template

## Motivation
There are many frontend frameworks and libraries out there and many of them are using a lot of dependencies and not really transparent about what they are doing and how they are doing it. <br/>
Master.ts is a library so it can be used with any framework or without any framework. <br/>
It also has no external dependencies, so it is very lightweight. <br/>

The main goal of this project is to make a library that is very lightweight and has a very small footprint. <br/>
It also aims be very easy to use and also transparent about what it is doing and how it is doing it. So no magic. <br/>

## Note
I was first trying to make something that has Resumable SSR, similar to Qwik.<br/>
And it was actually working out but i realized that i need to sacrafice many things in order to make it work right.<br/>
And since i was going to use this for IPFS and similar stuff without a server or cloud.<br/>
i thought SPA is good enough at least for now.<br/>
i can add and change features later.<br/>
its not like i need to make things backward competible, im gonna use this alone in my own projects, so i can make any breaking change i want, any syntax change i want, any change i want, later
