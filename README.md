# master-ts

A minimalist TypeScript library for supercharging your vanilla JavaScript applications with elegant and efficient user interfaces.

## Install

To install master-ts, please refer to the [Install Instructions](https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts/releases) available in the repository.

## Vite Plugin

Vite plugin doesn't support the latest version of master-ts atm.

~~MasterTS is a UI building library. So you may wonder, why does a library have a "Vite" plugin? The truth is, you don't actually need this plugin for MasterTS to work. The plugin simply bakes your MasterTS code, including HTML templates, at build time to improve runtime performance.~~

~~So it's recommended that you use [MasterTS Vite Plugin](https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts-vite-plugin)~~

## Documentation

Although documentation is not yet available, it will be once breaking changes cease for a period of 2 months.

## Motivation

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, we often see a lot of buzz around server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks and libraries. However, when it comes to single-page applications (SPAs), it feels like things have hit a bit of a standstill. Most SPA libraries have stopped growing, leaving developers like you on the hunt for a fresh and lightweight solution to elevate your vanilla JavaScript projects.

Enter "master-ts." This is more than just a library; it's your new secret weapon. While the world is racing toward SSR, "master-ts" is all about revitalizing SPAs to meet today's needs. Our aim is to end the search for a reliable, lightweight SPA library that can seriously amp up your vanilla JavaScript game.

Forget about those heavyweight frameworks; "master-ts" is your go-to for simplicity and efficiency. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking for a smoother workflow or a newcomer eager to dive into web development, "master-ts" has got your back.

The motivation behind "master-ts" is crystal clear: it's about embracing the power of straightforward, efficient development. This isn't just another framework; it's a minimalist TypeScript library that makes building elegant user interfaces a breeze.

So, why "master-ts"? Because it's time to bring back the spark to SPAs. Let's leave behind unnecessary complexities and rediscover the joy of coding with a library that's as dependable as it is fun to use.
