# Rules

1. This is a library.
   -  The preprocessor's role is to optimize code performance by calculating and inlining data, such as HTML templates, during compilation instead of runtime.
   -  No functionality should rely on the preprocessor.
2. Transparency is key. Avoid hidden or obscure code. Emphasize clarity and convenience.
3. Bugs should not be treated as features. Prioritize fixing issues over maintaining compatibility with erroneous behavior, even if it requires breaking changes.
4. Keep the library lightweight and efficient.
   -  Minimize dependencies and avoid unnecessary resource consumption.
5. Prioritize developer experience (DX).
   -  Design the library with developers in mind, ensuring ease of use and convenience.
6. Encourage code modularity and reusability.
   -  Promote the use of modular components for easy composition and reuse.
7. Perform regular performance optimizations.
   -  Continuously optimize code for improved performance and efficiency.
